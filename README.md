### **Opening Background Information**  
These days, pets like cats and dogs are more than just animals—they’re part of the family. But unlike us, they can’t always let us know when they’re in trouble. Sometimes they wander into tight corners or dangerous spots in the house, and we don’t even realize it. That’s where technology can step in. Using AI to track their movements in real-time can help ensure their safety and give pet owners peace of mind.

### **General Description of the Current Project**  
This project is about using the YOLOv7-tiny model to keep an eye on the movements of cats and dogs through home cameras or CCTV systems. YOLOv7-tiny is a lightweight version of the YOLOv7 model, which makes it perfect for devices with limited resources like home cameras. While it’s not as powerful as the full YOLOv7, it’s fast and efficient—just what’s needed for this kind of application. The main goal is to create a system that not only works well but can be scaled to different kinds of devices in the future.

### **Proposed Idea for Enhancements to the Project**  
1. **Making It Smarter in Different Settings:** We’ll train the AI on more diverse data so it can handle things like different lighting or messy backgrounds. This will help it work in any home environment.  
2. **Adding Alerts for Weird Behavior:** If a pet does something unusual or goes into a restricted area (like the balcony or kitchen), the system will send an alert to the owner.  
3. **Integrating GPS for Outdoor Tracking:** For pets that go outside, we could link the system to a GPS tracker, so owners know exactly where their pet is at all times.

### **Value and Significance of This Project**  
- **Keeping Pets Safe:** Real-time tracking can help prevent accidents and make sure pets are safe, even when their owners aren’t around.  
- **Future-Proofing:** YOLOv7-tiny’s lightweight nature makes it easy to use on multiple platforms, from home cameras to smartphones and beyond.  
- **Improving Quality of Life:** By helping avoid accidents and ensuring the safety of pets, this project can genuinely make a difference in the lives of both pets and their owners.

### **Current Limitations**  
- **Limited Data:** To make the system truly reliable, we’ll need a lot more training data that reflects how pets behave in all kinds of homes and situations.  
- **Accuracy Trade-Offs:** YOLOv7-tiny is efficient, but it’s not as precise or fast as the full YOLOv7 model, which could impact detection quality.  
- **Hardware Constraints:** Devices like home cameras have limited resources, so the system needs even more optimization to perform smoothly.

### **Literature Review**  
- **Comparing YOLOv7 and YOLOv7-tiny:** Studies comparing these two models show that while YOLOv7-tiny is great for lightweight applications, there’s some trade-off in accuracy and speed.  
- **Applications of Object Detection in Smart Home Systems:** There’s a growing body of research showing how YOLO models are being used in home cameras and security systems, providing a solid foundation for this project.  
- **Pet Behavior Analysis:** Research on detecting abnormal pet behavior can offer insights for building features like anomaly detection into this project.

This project has the potential to not just solve a problem but also bring real value to pet owners. By making it more efficient, accurate, and adaptable, it could easily become a must-have for every pet-friendly home.
